# Calculator

A simple calculator with memory slot and history of previous operations, built with C# and WPF.

---

## 📌 Applied Technologies
- C#
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a program that allows reusing the previous result in new operations.
- Display a history of past calculations for user reference.
- Practice WPF UI design and basic event-driven programming.

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first number (one or more digits).
3. Select an operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
4. Enter the second number.
5. ⚠️ **Note:** If you select division and enter “0,” an error message will be displayed.
6. Press the “=” button.
7. To use the previous result in a new operation, simply start from step 3.
